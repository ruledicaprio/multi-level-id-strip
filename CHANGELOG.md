# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-17

Rebrand of `docs-to-md` → **multi-level-id-strip (mlis)** plus a full architecture restructure and
the Tier-3 security milestone.

### Added
- **TD2 MRZ support** (2×36, ICAO 9303 Part 6) alongside TD1/TD3, verified against the official
  specimen, with checksum-verified OCR repair.
- **Date plausibility** (`mrz::DateValidity`): expiry-vs-today and DOB-before-expiry checks, computed
  clock-free (the caller supplies "today"), distinct from the check digits.
- **ISO 3166-1 / ICAO country names** (`mrz::country_name`), including the stateless/refugee/
  organization and specimen codes — the table follows the standard verbatim and neutrally.
- **`mlis-core`** crate: one canonical `Extraction` schema shared by every tier and the WASM demo.
- **Persistent gRPC inferer**: `proto/inferer.proto` + a warm Python sidecar (`python/inferer`,
  grpcio) reached over tonic — replaces the per-document `python extract_json.py` cold-load.
- **Pluggable OCR** via an `OcrEngine` trait: docling-serve (default, all platforms) and a native
  Tesseract+Leptonica engine (`ocr-daemon`, Linux/WSL, `--features native-ocr`).
- **Tier 3 security**: PII-free SHA-256 audit trail (`MLIS_AUDIT_LOG`), AES-256-GCM output
  encryption (`MLIS_KEY` → `.json.enc`, `mlis decrypt`), bearer-token auth with a hard refusal to
  bind non-loopback without a token, and optional rustls TLS.
- **Docker orchestration**: `docker/` Dockerfiles + `docker-compose.yml` (OCR + inferer + web);
  release LTO profile.

### Changed
- Crates/binaries renamed and regrouped under `crates/`: `pipeline`→`mlis-pipeline`,
  `docling-client`→`mlis-cli` (binary `mlis`), `docling-app`→`mlis-serve`.
- `mrz` split into `checksum` / `parser` / `dates` / `countries` modules (behavior preserved; all
  original tests kept as the regression gate).
- Tier-1 output enriched with resolved country names and the date-plausibility summary.

### Removed
- `extract_json.py` and root `requirements.txt` (superseded by `python/inferer` + `python/pyproject.toml`).

### Security
- The web app now enforces authentication and refuses wide-open binds by default; see
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## [0.3.0]
- Hybrid deterministic extraction: pure-Rust ICAO 9303 MRZ (TD1/TD3) with checksum-verified OCR
  repair (Tier 1), local Qwen 2.5 GGUF fallback (Tier 2), and a client-side WASM MRZ demo.

## [0.2.0]
- Air-gapped document pipeline: workspace, shared pipeline crate, CLI + axum web app.
