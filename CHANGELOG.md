## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-17

Native Tier-2 inference: the Qwen GGUF now runs in-process via `llama-cpp-2`, no Python sidecar
required. First step on the road to a single static musl binary — the legacy gRPC path stays as a
one-release fallback while the pure-Rust OCR and licensing milestones land.

### Added
- **`mlis-llm`** (new crate): loads and runs the Qwen2.5 GGUF in-process via `llama-cpp-2`, ChatML
  prompting, deterministic (temp-0, greedy) sampling, and JSON repair/parsing ported from
  `python/inferer/{prompts,adapter}.py`. SHA-256 model integrity check (`MLIS_MODEL_SHA256` override,
  `MLIS_MODEL_SKIP_VERIFY=1` to bypass) reusing `mlis_core::audit::sha256_hex`.
- **`InferBackend` trait** (`mlis-pipeline`): the Tier-2 seam is now pluggable — `NativeInferer`
  (feature `inferer-native`, **default**) wraps `mlis-llm`; `GrpcInferer` (feature `inferer-grpc`,
  still default this release) is the existing Python sidecar path, scheduled for removal once the
  pure-Rust OCR milestone lands and the sidecar has no remaining reason to exist. Selected at runtime
  via `MLIS_INFERER=native|grpc` (defaults to `native` when compiled in). Concurrency control (the
  single-flight semaphore + queue-depth counter) stays centralized in `Pipeline`, backend-agnostic.
- **Field-accuracy parity harness** (`crates/mlis-llm/tests/parity.rs`, `--ignored`): runs the native
  backend against `samples/*.md` and compares against the deterministic-MRZ ground truth in the
  matching `samples/*.json`, asserting a floor on the per-field match rate as a regression guard (not
  an accuracy gate — a 1.5B model reading OCR'd Markdown won't hit 100%, and Tier 1 exists precisely
  for the documents where it wouldn't need to).
- **CI**: `inferer-native`/`inferer-grpc` feature-combination build checks on every push; an opt-in
  `native-llm` job (`workflow_dispatch`) downloads the real GGUF and runs the e2e smoke test plus the
  parity harness.

### Changed
- `mlis doctor` now reports Tier-2 health via `Pipeline::infer_describe()`/`infer_health()` instead of
  hardcoding a gRPC `Health` RPC call — works against whichever backend is active.
- `docker/docker-compose.yml`'s `serve` service pins `MLIS_INFERER=grpc` for this release, so the
  existing `inferer` sidecar container keeps being used by default until compose gains a native
  profile.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-07-17

Bounded, observable inference queue — plus a safety gap the redesign surfaced.

### Added
- **`MLIS_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH`** (`mlis-serve`, default `4`): reject uploads with `503` once this many
  Tier-2 requests are queued/in-flight, instead of accepting them unboundedly and blocking behind
  the single-GPU semaphore. `Pipeline::llm_queue_depth()` exposes the live count.
- **`python/bench_inferer.py`**: a minimal concurrency benchmark (mock-mode, in-process gRPC server)
  reporting per-request latency and simulated rejection counts across candidate queue-depth caps —
  the "benchmark first" groundwork for any future batched-gRPC work, which remains unimplemented
  pending evidence it's needed.

### Changed
- The single-flight Tier-2 serialization primitive moved from a bare `Mutex<()>` to a `Semaphore` +
  atomic depth counter (same one-concurrent-call guarantee); streaming `delta` events are now
  forwarded best-effort (`try_send`) so a stalled browser connection no longer extends how long the
  GPU permit is held.

### Fixed
- `python/inferer/loader.py`'s `Llama` instance had **no serialization of its own** — the Rust-side
  lock was the only thing preventing the gRPC server's `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)` from
  making concurrent calls into the shared `llama.cpp` context, which risks corrupted output or a
  crash, not just VRAM exhaustion. Added a `threading.Lock` around every model call as defense-in-depth.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-17

Throughput & robustness: the Tier-2 UI freeze and the native OCR path's biggest accuracy gap.

### Added
- **Streaming Tier-2 inference (SSE)**: `proto/inferer.proto` gains a server-streaming `ExtractStream`
  RPC (`ExtractChunk{delta, done, result}`) alongside the existing unary `Extract`. The Python inferer
  uses `llama-cpp-python`'s native `stream=True` support to emit token deltas as the model generates;
  `mlis-serve`'s `/api/extract` now returns a Server-Sent Events stream that forwards those deltas to
  the browser in real time, so the upload page shows live "Extracting…" progress instead of a frozen
  status line for the ~few-second-to-30s Tier-2 wait. The Tier-1 (deterministic MRZ) fast path is
  unaffected — it still resolves in a single SSE `result` event with no visible change in behavior.
- **Native OCR preprocessing** (`ocr-daemon`, Linux/WSL): three new steps ahead of the existing Otsu
  binarization — DPI normalization (upscales small images to a ~300-DPI-equivalent floor), orientation
  correction (0/90/180/270°, scored by Tesseract's own confidence), and deskew (projection-profile
  method, ±15° search). Targets the main failure modes of phone-camera document photos that the native
  path previously had no defense against.

### Changed
- `Pipeline::process_document` is unchanged (CLI keeps its existing unary behavior); the OCR + Tier-1
  logic it shares with the new streaming path was extracted into a private `ocr_and_tier1` helper.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-17

Coverage hardening: closes the one untested boundary in v0.4.0 (the Rust↔Python gRPC bridge)
and the one untested surface (`mlis-serve` auth), plus a correctness fix each found.

### Added
- **Cross-language bridge test** (`crates/mlis-pipeline/tests/bridge_e2e.rs`): drives the real
  Python inferer (mock mode) from the real Rust `InfererClient`, catching drift across
  `proto/inferer.proto` / `tonic` / `grpcio` that no other test could — each other test mocks
  one side of the boundary. Wired into CI as a new `bridge` job.
- **`mlis-serve` auth test coverage** (was 0 tests): `is_loopback`, the non-loopback-without-token
  startup refusal, and the bearer-auth middleware (missing/wrong/non-bearer/correct token) are now
  unit-tested via `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot`.

### Fixed
- `is_loopback` used a string-prefix check, so an address like `127.0.0.1.evil.example:8080`
  was wrongly treated as loopback; now parses and exact-matches the host. Caught by the new tests.
- Tier-2 LLM output could echo HTML-escaped MRZ chevrons (`&lt;` instead of `<`) into fields like
  `mrz_line`, because docling's Markdown HTML-escapes them and the prompt passed it through
  verbatim. `python/inferer/prompts.py` now unescapes the Markdown before prompting the model.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-17

Rebrand of `docs-to-md` → **multi-level-id-strip (mlis)** plus a full architecture restructure and
the Tier-3 security milestone.

### Added
- **TD2 MRZ support** (2×36, ICAO 9303 Part 6) alongside TD1/TD3, verified against the official
  specimen, with checksum-verified OCR repair.
- **Date plausibility** (`mrz::DateValidity`): expiry-vs-today and DOB-before-expiry checks, computed
  clock-free (the caller supplies "today"), distinct from the check digits.
- **ISO 3166-1 / ICAO country names** (`mrz::country_name`), including the stateless/refugee/
  organization and specimen codes — the table follows the standard verbatim and neutrally.
- **`mlis-core`** crate: one canonical `Extraction` schema shared by every tier and the WASM demo.
- **Persistent gRPC inferer**: `proto/inferer.proto` + a warm Python sidecar (`python/inferer`,
  grpcio) reached over tonic — replaces the per-document `python extract_json.py` cold-load.
- **Pluggable OCR** via an `OcrEngine` trait: docling-serve (default, all platforms) and a native
  Tesseract+Leptonica engine (`ocr-daemon`, Linux/WSL, `--features native-ocr`).
- **Tier 3 security**: PII-free SHA-256 audit trail (`MLIS_AUDIT_LOG`), AES-256-GCM output
  encryption (`MLIS_KEY` → `.json.enc`, `mlis decrypt`), bearer-token auth with a hard refusal to
  bind non-loopback without a token, and optional rustls TLS.
- **Docker orchestration**: `docker/` Dockerfiles + `docker-compose.yml` (OCR + inferer + web);
  release LTO profile.

### Changed
- Crates/binaries renamed and regrouped under `crates/`: `pipeline`→`mlis-pipeline`,
  `docling-client`→`mlis-cli` (binary `mlis`), `docling-app`→`mlis-serve`.
- `mrz` split into `checksum` / `parser` / `dates` / `countries` modules (behavior preserved; all
  original tests kept as the regression gate).
- Tier-1 output enriched with resolved country names and the date-plausibility summary.

### Removed
- `extract_json.py` and root `requirements.txt` (superseded by `python/inferer` + `python/pyproject.toml`).

### Security
- The web app now enforces authentication and refuses wide-open binds by default; see
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## [0.3.0]
- Hybrid deterministic extraction: pure-Rust ICAO 9303 MRZ (TD1/TD3) with checksum-verified OCR
  repair (Tier 1), local Qwen 2.5 GGUF fallback (Tier 2), and a client-side WASM MRZ demo.

## [0.2.0]
- Air-gapped document pipeline: workspace, shared pipeline crate, CLI + axum web app.
