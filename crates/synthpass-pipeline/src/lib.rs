//! Shared document-processing pipeline:
//! OCR → Markdown on disk → **Tier 1** deterministic ICAO 9303 MRZ validation
//! → **Tier 2** LLM fallback (see [`InferBackend`]) → structured JSON.
//!
//! Tier 1 (the [`mrz`] crate) mathematically verifies every MRZ check digit.
//! When the composite checksum validates, the extraction is provably faithful
//! to the printed document and the probabilistic LLM step is skipped entirely.
//! The LLM only runs for documents without a valid MRZ (damaged scans,
//! non-standard documents, technical manuals).
//!
//! Tier 2 is a pluggable [`InferBackend`]: [`NativeInferer`] (feature
//! `inferer-native`, default, and the only backend as of v0.7.5) runs the
//! Qwen GGUF in-process via `synthpass-llm`, staying warm for the process
//! lifetime. See `infer::backend_from_env` for how it's constructed.
//!
//! Both binaries (`synthpass` CLI and `synthpass-serve` web server) are thin
//! wrappers around [`Pipeline::process_document`].
